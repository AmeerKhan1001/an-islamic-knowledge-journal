## Opinions

> Taking all the credit after surviving an adversity or earning an achievement, is an act of ingratitude.

> "I'm a warrior, I beat this disease", "I was about to drown but I didn't give up and made it to the shore", "I was rejected but I wanted this job so much so I worked very hard and changed my destiny", etc.

> There is no achievement in life or survival of an adversity except through God's help and intervention.

> We don't control all the variables of any equation to deserve the credit for an outcome. We don't even control our heart beat or flow of oxygen in our body to be able to continue with our efforts that we are so proud of, leave alone rest of the universe that affects our desired outcome.

> The One who gives, has the power to take it back whenever He wishes. We have to humble ourselves.
